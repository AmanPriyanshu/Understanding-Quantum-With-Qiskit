# Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit
Trying out different quantum circuits and stuff by implementing Qiskit.
Qiskit: <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit>

## Installation
Can be followed according to: <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit#installation>


Checout my Quantum Circuits in the Circuits Directory (https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit/blob/master/Circuits). It details what I have learnt and my implementation for most of it. I have followed the Qiskit Tutorials for these Circuits, however some changes and developments have been made in some of them, for Future Reference and better Understanding.
## Circuit 0: 
Here I introduce the basic outline of Implementing, Drawing and Simulating a simple Quantum Circuit in Qiskit. Take a look at the code here: https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit/blob/master/Circuits/Qiskit_circuit_0.ipynb

## Circuit 1: 
Introducing bock visulazation and unitary (matrix) representation. Take a look at the code here: https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit/blob/master/Circuits/Qiskit_circuit_1.ipynb

## Circuit 2: 
Implementing a Quantum Teleportation Algorithm as well as understanding nature of a few Gates. Take a look at the code here: https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Understanding-Quantum-With-Qiskit/blob/master/Circuits/Qiskit_circuit_2.ipynb
